## The Four Pillars

### Pillar 1: Rates & Currency
*The cost of money*
- US 10Y, DXY, Fed Funds
- When rates rise → Pressure on equities

### Pillar 2: Inflation
*Raw material costs*
- Brent Oil, Gold, CRB Index
- Rising inflation → Central bank tightening risk

### Pillar 3: Growth
*Economic activity*
- PMI data (US, China, Euro, Global)
- Above 50 = Expansion, Below 50 = Contraction

### Pillar 4: Risk Appetite
*Market sentiment*
- VIX, HY Spread, MOVE Index
- Low VIX + Tight spreads = Risk-on
